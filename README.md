# Twitter Auth

This function is deployed to [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). But can quickly be tweaked to work with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs).

All code is self-documented. Aside from the specific names of bases and tables in Airtable, everything is easily portable and ready to fork. You'll just need to provide your environment variables.
